These were preprocessed from .jpeg images. Notice that their values are between 0 to 255, consider if you need any further preprocessing.\n","\n","You are required to train your model on (x_train, y_train) and finally report your accuracy score on (x_test, y_test). Of course, you are encouraged to further split (x_train, y_train) into train and validation datasets."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Aa_TwRNLFzL4"},"source":["Conduct the following experiments:\n","\n","1.   Begin with a simple model: four 2d convolutional layers followed by two fully connected layer (one hidden layer and one output layer). Between these hidden layers, you can use dropout, max-pooling, batch normalization, or any other non-trainable layer we've seen for regularization and dimensionality reduction. You can choose whatever sizes/numbers of filters/neurons you want.\n","2.   Build your own CNN. There are no constraints on the architecture, so just enjoy yourself and be as creative as you want.\n","3. Transfer learning: load a pre-trained model from [Keras applications](https://keras.io/api/applications/). Since these models were trained on Imagenet their weights might be useful. Add a fully-connected layer on top of the trained model and train it. Make sure you only train your FC layer and not the re-trained model!\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-vNoXCyXtn7s"},"source":["## Submission guidelines\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sQY9vpoqHd_n"},"source":["\n","Practically the same guidelines as in Assignment I.\n","\n","**This is a group project (3-4 members)**.
