Begin with a simple model: four 2d convolutional layers followed by two fully connected layer (one hidden layer and one output layer). Between these hidden layers, you can use dropout, max-pooling, batch normalization, or any other non-trainable layer we've seen for regularization and dimensionality reduction. You can choose whatever sizes/numbers of filters/neurons you want.\n","2.   Build your own CNN. There are no constraints on the architecture, so just enjoy yourself and be as creative as you want.\n","3. Transfer learning: load a pre-trained model from [Keras applications](https://keras.io/api/applications/). Since these models were trained on Imagenet their weights might be useful. Add a fully-connected layer on top of the trained model and train it.
